## Development notes

Currently nothing has been implemented for this game.
I have initialised Rspec and bundle but do not have any gems installed.
My first step will to be to develop user stories and then model some classes based on those.
Afterwards, I will be able to start on developing tests for the project.


## User stories

```
As a player,
So that I can participate in the game,
I would like to be able to get a hand of two cards.
```
```
As a player,
So that I can know how good my hand is,
I would like to know what cards I have in my hand.
```
```
As a player,
So that I don't have to do maths,
I would like to have my current score on display.
```
```
As a player,
So that I can get a new card,
I would like the option to hit.
```
```
As a player,
So that I don't go bust,
I would like the option to stick
```
```
As a player,
So that I don't play by myself,
I would like the dealer to have a hand also
```
```
As a player,
So that I can know whether I have won or lost,
I would like the dealer to have a total hand score to compare against mine.
```
```
As a player,
So that I can get a gambling addiction,
I would like the option to play multiple rounds.
